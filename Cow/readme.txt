This purpose of this project is to draw and display a cow with Java.

This fulfills the specification as a representation of a cow was
successfully drawn and displayed.

Several components of the project that can be improved include providing
an automatically repositioning feature to the sun such that it remains in
the top right corner of the frame window even when the window is resized.
This can be resolved by positioning the sun with reference to the right edge
of the frame by using the getWidth and getHeight methods to obtain the width
and height of the frame.

Some challenges that occurred in the process of making the code include
correctly positioning the various components of the cow in the right place.
However, this was not too difficult to resolve as trial and error proved
sufficient to know the proper positioning of the cowâ€™s components after a
couple tries. Other challenges that occurred include using various methods
of the Graphics class correctly, and this was also resolved similarly
through trial and error and referencing the Java API Documentation.

The Java API Documentation for the Graphics class was used extensively as a
resource for this project.
